									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>I graduated from Montana State University with a bachelor's in computer science last year.  I currently live in Bozeman Montana and
									  I am still curently working at FedEx part-time, but I don't wont to work full-time because I need to get experience in my feild.  I am trying to get anything entry-level to get my foot in the door. I would like to eventually become a full stack developer, but I am currently looking for work as a front end developer first. I am also persuing a help desk job to get started I want to move to cypbersecurity at some point.
									   I am currently working toward getting a CompTIA security+ as well as a few google certificates in order to help open as many doors as posible. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/WaterFalls.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p> One of the reasons that I chose to go into computer science is becuase there is always more to learn and grow.  I love to work toward something new and get better and better.</p>
